# Build-an-Image-Classifier-with-Tensorflow

In this project, I will train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. I'll be using data from Oxford of 102 flower categories,  see a few examples below.

This project is broken down into multiple steps:

1. Load the image dataset and create a pipeline.
2. Build and Train an image classifier on this dataset.
3. Use your trained model to perform inference on flower images.
We'll lead you through each part which you'll implement in Python.

When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it. Go build your own dataset and make something new.
